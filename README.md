A method to implement object reification based on law of closure in Gestalt psychology.

Construct object via combination of discontinuous edges, detects key vertices and then divides boundary into small edges. Virtual edge is generated to connect two edges as straight line, ellipse, or circle. Phases of the project:

1 - Edge and Boundary Detection

2 - Key Vertex Detection

3 - Virtual Edge Generation

4 - Object Constrution
